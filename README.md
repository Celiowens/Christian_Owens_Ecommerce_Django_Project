# Christian_Owens_Ecommerce_Django_Project
This is my Software Engineering Individual Project. The purpose of this code is to present a ecommerce website that allows the user to order items.
The admin can change the pictures, change the price, and take in the appropiate actions afterwards. The username and password is: bartz

Within the admin page, you can add pictures and customize the prices of the items.
You can visibly see the items in the main page. 

The pages are as followed: '/admin', '/cart', and '/checkout'
